# Database Settings
The [MindBigData](https://mindbigdata.com/opendb/) has been recorded by David Vivancos with the Emotiv EPOC device. This dataset has been gathered using a 14-channel cap. The placement of the EEG
channel electrodes is shown in Figure 1, and the channel names considered in the recording
procedure are A.F.3, F.7, F.3, FC.5, T.7, P7, O.1 in the left hemisphere and A.F.4, F.8, F.4, F.C.6, T.8, P8, O.2 in the right hemisphere as shown in dark blue in this figure.

A total of 9120 brain signals of 2 s captured at a theoretical sampling rate of about
128 samples per second or 128 Hz are selected as MindBig dataset used in this paper. Total
number of samples in each channel used for processing is 250. The brain signals were
captured while a single digit from 0 to 9 corresponding to digits of the Modified National
Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset in Figure 2 has been shown for 2 s.
The numbers have been represented on a 65-inch TV screen in a white font over a total
black background. The appearance of digits was random, with a black screen between
them. The number of 9120 EEG records corresponding to 912 signals of each category are
considered for classification and salient arithmetic data extraction.

# CNN

## Introduction
Each deep convolutional network is composed of several layers. The pooling layer is
an essential layer in CNN, which minimizes the spatial size of feature vector maps obtained
from the convolutional layer. This layer has no training parameter and performs a simple
sampling. The most famous pooling layers are called average pooling and max pooling.
For example, for maximum integration, a predefined window is considered that moves
over the image to select the maximum value and ignore the rest of the numbers. The size
of the filter and the size of the stride step in this layer are considered proportional to the
optimal size for mapping the obtained feature of each layer.
The fully connected layer forms the final layer of CNN networks, which is used to
classify the extracted feature maps. This layer is similarly present in multilayer perceptron
(MLP) networks. After displaying the feature vectors obtained from convolutional layers,
weight vector coefficients are assigned in this layer. The output corresponding to the
number of classes available for classification can be achieved.
The following describes some other commonly used layers in CNN networks, includ-
ing the random elimination layer and the batch normalizer layer. The use of the dropout
layer in CNN networks strongly prevents the phenomenon of data overfitting in the train-
ing process. The function of this layer is to omit some neurons during training randomly.
To optimize the coefficients, these randomly selected neurons are not considered during
the learning process. Mathematically, neurons are discarded with probability (p-1), and
other neurons are retained with probability (p).
The normalization layer is used to normalize the data inside the network. By perform-
ing various calculations on data, the distribution of data will change. The batch normalizer
layer increases the training speed of the network by reducing the internal covariance of
data distribution and accelerates the convergence process. The performance of this layer
will be based on the calculation of the average and variance of data according to (1).

## The Proposed Network Architecture
The one-dimensional convolutional layers in the first part of the proposed network classify
the EEG signals related to 10 different numbers of MNIST images with arithmetic content.
EEG signal classification happens in this stage, and the signal can be classified according
to the extracted features for 10 categories. After the preprocessing stage of the recorded
EEG signals in response to the visual image with arithmetic content, we have several
deep layers to extract the output vector of the first part of the proposed network to be
applied to the next generator adversarial network. 
Figure 3 represents the schematic of the CNN fragment to classify the input EEG signal
into the correct category of the MNIST dataset. The visual stimulation related to the MNIST dataset appears on an LCD to a human volunteer, corresponding to the considered timing of occurrence for each image and time-lapse between sequential images. The EEG signals are recorded during the experiment. Normalizing the EEG time samples is performed
considering each EEG channelâ€™s mean and standard deviation. The pre-processed EEG
signals are applied as input to the proposed one-dimensional CNN network.
The structure of the CNN fragment of the network consists of three convolutional
layers, as illustrated in Figure 3. The rectified linear unit is selected for the activation function in each layer. After each convolutional layer, a dropout and batch normalization are considered to prevent overfitting. Flattening of the output of the third convolutional layer is achieved. It is imposed to a linear layer, and the output vector of a dense, full-connected layer is passed through a log_softmax classifier layer to classify the input EEG signal. The output of the linear layer is a vector with 2500 elements, and it is the vector applieded as input to the next deep network of the proposed CNN-GAN to extract and obtain the MNIST images used as the stimulation. The details of the CNN network of the proposed architecture are explained in Table 2

# GAN

## introduction
The generative adversarial networks (GANs) [7] include generator and discriminator
networks. The generative model G consists of some layers to fit a random vector y with
probability distribution P(y) into a desired data distribution. The discriminative part, named
D, compares data from the expected distribution and data obtained from the generator
part. These two networks are trained simultaneously, and the training will continue to
see no improvement in network optimization. The cost function of GAN can be described
as follows:

## The proposed method
- The GAN consists of generator and discriminative networks in order to map the one-dimensional extracted feature vector of the EEG signal in the first part to the two-dimensional image array. The main layers of GAN in the proposed technique are two-dimensional convolutional blocks to reconstruct the salient images.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34e13185-addf-4249-9144-29a4c255f158)
- The salient images are created using the SALICON approach to apply as the ground reference data of the GAN network.
- The generative adversarial network is trained, and the network weights will be determined. After this stage of the procedure, tuning the weights of the trained network will be performed and transfer learning will be employed to reconstruct the original visual image stimulation.
- The architectural details of the generator and adversarial networks can be seen in Figure 5.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0da07c7d-9f3d-4b3a-8030-12c6d4e85221)
- Details of the image: The flattened vector with 2500 elements is passed through a dense layer of the generator network and four transposed two-dimensional convolution layers. Also, an additional two-dimensional convolutional layer is needed to fit the output image dimension to the desired dimension. The adversarial consists of three sequential layers of two-dimensional convolutional layers. The output of these layers is imposed to the dropout layer, and then the flattened output vector passes a fully connected layer to judge about fake or real data.
The structural and dimensional details of layers in the generator are represented in
Figure 6 and Table 3.
- The input vector dimension is equal to 2500, and after passing through two dense layers, the output vector dimension is equal to 20,000. The reshaped vector
of dense layer output is applied in the first transposed convolution layer. The number
of kernels in transposed convolutional layers is considered equal to four to have four
two-dimensional outcomes in each layer. Considering different kernels and strides in five

# Evaluation Metrics for Classification and Salient Image Extraction

The saliency feature map and the ground truth feature vector are two necessary inputs
for calculating the saliency evaluation metrics. The level of similarity can be represented by
considering these metrics.
The most used metrics for classification are described in (3) as sensitivity, accuracy,
precision, and recall based on true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and
false negative (FN)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/899eebb7-bbc5-4227-b794-6141002a1a39)

Three important metrics for evaluating saliency are described as follows.
Similarity metric (SIM) is used to measure similarity between distributions [52 ]. Nor-
malization of the input signal vectors is performed, and the sum of minimum values at
each pixel results as S.I.M. The saliency map is shown with S.M and the fixation map is
represented with F.M:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ce489fe-4b5c-4919-915a-a0a097eff41f)

In (5), pixel locations are represented with j. The value of SIM is equal to one for inputs
with identical distributions, while this metric would be zero if there is no similarity and
overlap between distributions.

Another saliency evaluation metric is structural similarity (SS.I.M), calculated using
different windows of an image [ 53 ]. The SSIM is computed considering two sampling
windows, m and n, with size L Ã— L:

A metric for assessing the affine connectedness of distributions is Pearso.nâ€™s correlation
coefficient (CC) [52]. CC can be computed as in Equation (7).
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99106d57-06b3-4ba2-804b-0f1451a1e544)
The covariance between FM and SM in (7) is represented with Ïƒ(SM, FM). This metric
is unaffected by linear transformations. This evaluation metric would treat false negatives
and false positives equally and, therefore, is a symmetric function. The similar magnitudes
of the saliency map and the reference ground truth would result in high positive values
of CC.
